Rice Leaf Disease Detection Using Logistic Regression.

We have used the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the model containing Rice Leaf disease detection data and attained 80 percent testing accuracy and 84 percent training accuracy.
Overall Solution approach
In this innovative solution approach, the convergence of three cutting-edge
technologies—Natural Language Processing (NLP), Ontology, and Vision 
Transformer (ViT)—provides a comprehensive framework for tackling the 
challenges of plant disease detection and crop yield prediction in agriculture. ViT 
models, expert at extracting the specific features from plant images, facilitate robust 
disease detection without relying on predefined rules. Simultaneously, NLP 
techniques analyse textual descriptions of plant diseases, enhancing the depth of 
disease understanding. The heart of the system lies in a domain-specific ontology, 
serving as both the knowledge repository and the bridge between visual and textual 
data. This integrated approach assesses disease severity and capitalizes on historical 
data to forecast crop yields accurately as well. This innovative combined approach 
marks a significant step forward in data-driven agriculture, ensuring both
